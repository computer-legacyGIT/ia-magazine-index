"# ia-magazine-index"  "# ia-magazine-index" 

This project exists to index, catalogue or otherwise make the ability of tracking what exists a magazine on The Internet Archive.

This project repository will NOT include any magazine content (such as images, PDF, CBZ, ZIP etc.) - that content is expected to be hosted on The Internet Archive.

This project will INCLUDE metadata about magazines that have been submitted to The Internet Archive in parseable XML files.

Directory Structure
To aid with browsing, a level of structure has been created to store the XML files.

Top Level - Country of Publication
Sub Level - Name of Publication
File Level - An XML file that follows the format of [Name of Publication][Date of Publication in YYYYMMDD format][Any extra title information such as issue number]

File Structure
Files will be simple XML files with the idea of being parsable
